    <h2>Pedagogy</h2>
    <p>These principles have guided me in the design of this tutorial, and I hope that they will help you understand the meta-project and thus accelerate your learning:</p>
    <li><strong>Programming is best learnt by doing.</strong> As such, a high proportion of the material consists of exercises, and struggling with them should occupy most of your time.</li>
    <li><strong>Projects should be realistic and substantial.</strong> This helps retention by situating the new knowledge in a meaningful context. To this end, I have picked a meaty dataset with real-world implications and designed exercises to draw these out.</li>
    <li><strong>Tutorials should be beautiful.</strong> Many of the resources that we love, like <a href='https://learnyouagoodhaskell.com'>Learn You A Haskell for Great Good!</a> and <a href='https://beautifulracket.com'>Beautiful Racket</a> are beautiful, and I don't think it's a coincidence.</li>
    <p>Finally, let's clarify our goal. It isn't to know the rules for how to use <code>WITH</code>, or when to pick a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> over an <code>INNER JOIN</code>. We know we have been successful if after writing a SQL query, you can close your eyes and imagine what the computer would do and what output it would give. It is this <i>mental model</i> that we are after.</p>

    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>The dataset we will examine documents Texas death row inmates executed between 1976, when the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty, and 2017. On one level, it is simply a part of a mundane programming tutorial. On another, each row represents immense suffering, lives lost, and in some cases redemption and acceptance.</p>
    <p>In preparing for this dataset, I was deeply moved by a number of the statements and found myself re-evaluting my position on capital punishment. I hope that as we examine the data, you too will contemplate the deeper issues at play.<p>
    <p>The designers at Quora, where I used to work, often talked about the system-view versus the story-view. This dataset happens to be strong at both. I hope that the exercises will bring out the incredible stories behind some of the cases, as well as patterns that aid our understanding of capital punishment in Texas.</p>
