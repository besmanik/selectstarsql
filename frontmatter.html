    <p>While working as a data scientist at Quora, I used to have people come to me all the time asking me for resources for learning SQL, but struggled to find something I could stand behind.</p>
    <p>I was looking for something free, that doesn't require registration, and cares about pedagogy; something that genuinely cares about its users.</p>
    <p>My hope is that like <a href='http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters'>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</a> and <a href='https://beautifulracket.com'>Beautiful Racket</a> have done for Haskell and Racket, Select Star SQL will become the best place on the internet for learning SQL.

    <h2>Pedagogy</h2>
    <p>These principles have guided the design of this tutorial:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Programming is best learnt by doing.</strong><br>A high proportion of the material consists of exercises, and struggling with them should occupy most of your time.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Exercises should be realistic and substantial.</strong><br>To quote <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40435064/what-alan-kay-thinks-about-the-iphone-and-technology-now">Alan Kay</a>: "You never let [the learner] do something that isnâ€™t the real thing&mdash;but you have to work your ass off to figure out what the real thing is in the context of the way their minds are working at that developmental level."</p>
        <p>Likewise, the exercises here have been designed to introduce increasingly sophisticated SQL techniques while exploring the dataset in ways that people would actually be interested in.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Tutorials should be beautiful.</strong><br>
        It seems like trying to make the best product for your users is synonymous with making something beautiful. Is it a surprise that <a href='http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters'>Learn You A Haskell for Great Good!</a> and <a href='https://beautifulracket.com'>Beautiful Racket</a> are both beautiful?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Finally, let's clarify our goal. It isn't to know the rules for how to use <code>WITH</code>, or when to pick a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> over an <code>INNER JOIN</code>: We know we've been successful if after writing a SQL query, you can close your eyes and imagine what the computer would do and what output it would give. It is this <i>mental model</i> that we are after.</p>

    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>Our dataset documents Texas death row inmates executed from 1976, when the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty, to the present. It was extracted from the <a href='https://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html'>Texas Department of Criminal Justice</a> website using automatic means where possible. However, much of the pre-1995 data is only available as images of physical documents and these required painstaking manual extraction.</p>
    
    <p>The raw data is available as a csv for <a href="data/dataset.csv">download</a>. It is probably the most complete set of Texas death row data on the internet.</p>

    <p>On one level, the data is simply a part of a mundane programming tutorial. On another, each row represents immense suffering, lives lost, and in some cases redemption and acceptance. In preparing for this dataset, I was deeply moved by a number of the statements and found myself re-evaluting my position on capital punishment. I hope that as we examine the data, you too will contemplate the deeper issues at play.</p>
