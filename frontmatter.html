    <h2>Impetus</h2>
    <p>When I was a data scientist at Quora, I used to have people come to me asking for resources for learning SQL. I struggled to find something I could stand behind because I felt that a good resource had to be free, not require registration, and care about pedagogy. Basically, it had to genuinely care about its users and there was nothing like that around.</p>
    <p>By overcoming some minor <a href="#technicals">technical hurdles</a>, I believe that Select Star SQL has met this standard. My hope is that like <a href='http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters'>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</a> and <a href='https://beautifulracket.com'>Beautiful Racket</a> have done for Haskell and Racket, Select Star SQL will become the best place on the internet for learning SQL.

    <h2>Pedagogy</h2>
    <p>These principles have guided the design of this tutorial:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Programming is best learnt by doing.</strong><br>A high proportion of the material consists of exercises, and struggling with them should occupy most of your time.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Exercises should be realistic and substantial.</strong><br>To quote <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40435064/what-alan-kay-thinks-about-the-iphone-and-technology-now">Alan Kay</a>: "You never let [the learner] do something that isnâ€™t the real thing&mdash;but you have to work your ass off to figure out what the real thing is in the context of the way their minds are working at that developmental level."</p>
        <p>Likewise, the exercises here have been designed to introduce increasingly sophisticated SQL techniques while exploring the dataset in ways that people would actually be interested in.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Tutorials should be beautiful.</strong><br>
        It seems like trying to make the best product for your users is synonymous with making something beautiful. Is it a surprise that <a href='http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters'>Learn You A Haskell for Great Good!</a> and <a href='https://beautifulracket.com'>Beautiful Racket</a> are both beautiful?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Finally, let's clarify our goal. It isn't to know the rules for how to use <code>WITH</code>, or when to pick a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> over an <code>INNER JOIN</code>: We know we've been successful if after writing a SQL query, you can close your eyes and imagine what the computer would do and what output it would give. It is this <i>mental model</i> that we are after.</p>

    <a name="dataset"></a>
    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>Our dataset documents Texas death row inmates executed from 1976, when the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty, to the present. It was extracted from the <a href='https://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html'>Texas Department of Criminal Justice</a> website using automatic means where possible. However, much of the pre-1995 data is only available as images of physical documents and these required painstaking manual extraction.</p>
    
    <p>The raw data is available as a csv for <a href="data/dataset.csv">download</a>. It is probably the most complete set of Texas death row data on the internet.</p>

    <p>On one level, the data is simply a part of a mundane programming tutorial. On another, each row represents immense suffering, lives lost, and in some cases redemption and acceptance. In preparing for this dataset, I was deeply moved by a number of the statements and found myself re-evaluting my position on capital punishment. I hope that as we examine the data, you too will contemplate the deeper issues at play.</p>

    <h2>Technicals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Alasql</strong>. One of the challenges to making this site free was to avoid paying for web hosting. But to give users a hands-on experience with a database (see <a href="#pedagogy">Pedagogy</a>), one would have to host and pay for a proper backend somewhere. Thankfully, client-side databases exist. This allows me to serve a static page from <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> for free. The page sets up and runs an <a href="https://github.com/agershun/alasql">Alasql</a> database on your browser. It's not really industrial strength, but does the job!</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Matthew Butterick</strong>. I met Matthew at the <a href="https://summer-school.racket-lang.org/2018/">Racket Summer School</a> and was blown away by the great work he's done on <a href="http://beautifulracket.com">Beautiful Racket</a> and <a href="http://practicaltypography.com">Practical Typography</a>. As you can tell, I borrowed a ton of design ideas from there.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Jekyll</strong>. I don't know any fancy web technologies, so <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> was the only thing that stopped me from having to write up all the html by hand. Thank goodness for Jekyll.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Web Components</strong>. I was able to reuse a lot of code by writing the exercise and quiz components as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">custom html tags</a>. It's a relatively new development as I understand, and I hope that W3C continues to push for broader adoption.</p></li>
